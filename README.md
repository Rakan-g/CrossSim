CrossSim: Exploting **C**ross Project **R**elationships for Computing **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware **Sim**ilarity
================
 
CrossSim is a versatile tool by exploiting the graph representation: it can incorporate various features into the similarity computation, e.g., third-party libraries, API funtion calls, package names, to name a few. An evaluation on a dataset containing 580 GitHub projects shows that the tool outperforms MUDABlue, CLAN, and RepoPal with respect to different quality metrics.

This repository contains tools and dataset for the following papers:

Running CrossSim
-----------
To execute CrossSim on a dataset consisting of 580 (tool/CrossSim/evalaution.properties file specifies the input path of mined data)  GitHub projects, please run the following command:

  ```sh 
  $ mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.crossminer.similaritycalculator.CrossSim.Runner"
  ```

Input/Output Formats
--------------------

#### Input Format

CrossSim takes as input two files: Graph is stored in file "graph", and each line in the file has the following format:

```node1#node2```

which specifies the representation of one edge in the graph: node1 -> node2.

File "dictionary" is used to store all the artifacts included in the computation. It serves as a reference to the graph nodes. The nodes are either:
* users/developers, 
*projects, or 
*dependencies (third party library).


#### Output Format

CrossSim outputs a matrix of similarity scores. This matrix is stored in a set of files (one file for each project in the dataset). Each file contains the ranked list of similarity to all the other projects in the dataset.
For example, the first few lines in the output file ```AKSW_RDFUnit.txt``` for the usage example above are:

RepoPal, MUDABlue, and CLAN
----------------

For comparison purposes, we implemented [RepoPal](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7884605/), [MUDABlue](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1371919/), addition [CLAN](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6227178/). These are provided in the *tool/RepoPal*, *tool/MudaBlue*, and *tool/CLAN* folder respectively. Each folder contains a readme file that describes how to run the corresponding tool.                                                                  

Datasets
--------

The dataset used in the paper is available in the ```dataset/``` subdirectory. In particular:
  * <b>queries.txt</b> is the list of queries used in the evaluation;
  * <b>human evaluation.xlsx</b> contains the qualitative analysis results. It inludes the scores given by human evaluators;
  * <b>repository.txt</b> is the list of repositories;
  * RepoPal results are in <b>RepoPal_Results.csv</b>;
  * CrossSim3 results are in <b>CrossSim_Results.csv</b>;
  * MudaBlue results are in <b>MudaBlue_Results.csv</b>;
  * CLAN results are in <b>Clan_Results.csv</b>;
